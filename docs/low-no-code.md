# Low-Code vs No-Code

## What is Low-Code?

Low-Code is a **software development approach** that requires minimal coding to build applications. It provides a **visual development environment** where developers can use drag-and-drop components, model-driven logic, and pre-built integrations.

### **Specifications of Low-Code**
- Requires **basic programming knowledge** for customization.
- Provides **visual development tools** but allows **manual coding** when needed.
- Supports **integration with APIs, databases, and third-party services**.
- Best suited for **enterprise applications, automation, and workflow management**.

## What is No-Code?

No-Code is a **fully visual approach** to building applications **without writing any code**. It enables **business users and non-developers** to create functional applications through simple drag-and-drop interfaces.

### **Specifications of No-Code**
- **No coding skills** required.
- Offers **pre-built templates and drag-and-drop functionality**.
- Limited flexibility for **custom integrations and complex workflows**.
- Best for **small businesses, MVPs, and simple automation tasks**.
